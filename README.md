Overview
---
Utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

#### The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Initialize Kalman filter variables
* Predict where our object is going to be after a time step Î”t
* Update where our object is based on sensor measurements
* Make the prediction and update steps repeat themselves in a loop.
* Calculate root mean squared error comparing the Kalman filter results with the provided ground truth.
* Achieve RMSE <= [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52] 

Project Deliverables
---
* `FusionEKF.cpp` initializes the filter, calls the predict function, calls the update function
* `kalman_filter.cpp` defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar
* `tools.cpp` function to calculate RMSE and the Jacobian matrix
